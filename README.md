# What is a portfolio web developer? :sweat_drops: :building_construction: ```	:briefcase: ```

```
Building a web development portfolio is a personal project into which you can put maximum effort and heart.
Naturally, you want your web developer portfolio to look its best and for it to work flawlessly, 
without any glitches or lag.
```
```
In short, an online portfolio is a website you create to show off your skills, 
experience, projects, and even your personality to potential clients and/or employers
```
`
There are tons of benefits to building your own portfolio website, including:
`

[ :point_right: ]  Increased visibility, credibility and authority in your industry

[ :point_right: ]  When someone searches your name in Google, your website appears at the top

[ :point_right: ]  Hiring managers and clients can find you, instead of you trying to find them 

[ :point_right: ]  Gives you a chance to show off your creativity and personality

[ :point_right: ]  Shows that you‚Äôre a professional, which means employers and clients are more likely to trust you and your work

**So, what does a portfolio look like and what information does it include? Let‚Äôs jump into the ``` 10 ``` 
things you should consider adding to your tech portfolio website 
:earth_africa: (with real-life portfolio website examples for inspiration).**

## 1 - A custom logo and tagline :white_check_mark:

*If you‚Äôre more in the design space, show off your skills by creating your own awesome logo for your online portfolio website.*

**Then, create a strong tagline underneath**. *This can quickly tell visitors who you are and what you can offer them. Making your message clear off the bat is important.*

## 2 - A killer site design :white_check_mark:

*What does a portfolio look like? Whatever you want it to, as long as it looks polished and reflects who you are. Having a clear and concise online portfolio/resume design is important, no matter what. But if you‚Äôre more into design than development, it becomes even more significant.*

## 3 - Relevant skills :white_check_mark:

*The keyword is `relevant`. The more skills you have, usually the better‚Äîbut only if you‚Äôll actually use them in the kind of work you want. (Hot tip: do not overload your portfolio with irrelevant skills!)*

*These skills could have been picked up in online courses or from previous positions. Even things you learned while volunteering or in school. There‚Äôs no wrong way to gain a skill.*

*As long as they‚Äôre relevant to the jobs you want to start landing: that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important.*

## 4 - Relevant education, coursework, and certificates :white_check_mark:

*This includes courses (online or offline) or even college classes. Some online learning platforms even integrate with your `LinkedIn`, making it easy to add certificates from completed courses.*

## 5 - Any previous jobs that have some transferable experience :white_check_mark:

*Ever had a job where you used transferable skills? Feature that experience on your online portfolio (and make sure to specify how it ties in).*

## 6 -  Downloadable resume :white_check_mark:

*People still use hard-copy resumes today‚Äîeven though it may seem like a rarity. This is especially true in more traditional workplaces, with human resource divisions.*

*Because of this, you should make it simple for potential employers to download a copy of your resume and print it out if they want to.*

## 7 - A bio or about page (tell your story!) :white_check_mark:

```Let your personality come through. It‚Äôs *your* portfolio, after all!```

*Plus, it has been shown that stories are more engaging than just listing out information.*

## 8 - A photo  :white_check_mark:

*People trust brands (and people) when they can put a ‚Äúface‚Äù to them. Your portfolio website picture doesn‚Äôt have to be a gray-background headshot with a suit and tie, but keep the photo professional. This means no obvious selfies and an outfit that is safe for work, not the nightclub.*

*Not sure which photo to use? Look to the Buffer blog, where they recently put together an entire article about [great profile photos.](https://buffer.com/pricing/publish)*

*Or you can always use it as an opportunity to show off your personality/interests*

## 9 - Visible contact information :white_check_mark:

*Don‚Äôt make it an obstacle course for potential clients or employers to find your email address or phone number. Unless, of course, you don‚Äôt want people contacting you.*

## 10 - Social media accounts (if relevant) :white_check_mark:

*If you have any active (and relevant) social media accounts, include links to them on your online portfolio site‚Äôs contact or ‚Äúabout me‚Äù page.*

```Also, consider maintaining a presence on industry-specific social media accounts```

### A few basic social media ground rules:

* Don‚Äôt complain about your current job/boss/coworkers :rotating_light: .
* Avoid posting pictures getting #whitegirlwasted at the club on a Tuesday :camera_flash: .
* Stay away from insults and #drama ü§¨ .

`These rules apply even if you choose not to include your social media accounts on your portfolio or resume. Always be prepared for clients/employers to look you up on Google. (I can almost 90% promise that they will.)`
